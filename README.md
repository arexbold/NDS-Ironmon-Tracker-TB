# Triple Bond custom NDS-Ironmon-Tracker

# Info

This fork was made to tweak the NDS Ironmon Tracker in order to make it more suitable for the Triple Bond Challenge. **All credit goes to Brian0255 (OnlySpaghettiCode) and contributors for all their work.**

If you're looking for the ACTUAL NDS Ironmon Tracker go here: [release page](https://github.com/Brian0255/NDS-Ironmon-Tracker/releases) for changelogs and downloads.


### Compatibility

Will only work with a Triple Bond patch on Pokemon HeartGold.


# Other problems

I've modified this so any bugs will most likely be my fault. There is a FAQ section on the original page that might help with more common errors: [https://github.com/Brian0255/NDS-Ironmon-Tracker#FAQ](https://github.com/Brian0255/NDS-Ironmon-Tracker#FAQ) **OTHERWISE PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER THEM FOR HELP SINCE I'VE MODIFIED THIS.** You're better off using the original tracker if you're not playing the Triple Bond Challenge.
